-- THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST IN THE PROJECT
--   Proves one nonprofit cannot read or write another's records. If this ever
--   stops failing where it should fail, beneficiary data leaks between
--   organisations and cannot be recalled once it is on a phone in a village.
--
--   Tested at the database level rather than through the app, because the
--   database is where the rule actually lives. Runs on every push.

begin;

-- Two organisations, and one worker in each.
insert into organisations (id, name) values
  ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000a1', 'Test Organisation A'),
  ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000b1', 'Test Organisation B')
on conflict (id) do nothing;

-- profiles points at the sign-in table, so the two test people must exist there
-- first. We are testing the permission rules, not the sign-up screen, so the
-- bare minimum is enough. Everything is undone at the end.
insert into auth.users (id, email, instance_id, aud, role)
values ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000a2', 'worker.a@test.invalid',

on conflict (id) do nothing;

-- Creating a sign-in record now fires the trigger from migration 0002, which
-- gives that person their own brand-new organisation. For this test we want
-- them in the two specific organisations above, so we overwrite what the
-- trigger chose. (Without this the test fails with "worker A cannot see their
-- own submissions" -- which is correct, because the trigger had moved them.)
